<p>If you are in need of some self-signed certificates for use in Java, and are using Linux, then I have developed a small shell script that will do all the work for you. You can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/bsaunder/ShellScripts/tree/master/SSL_Gen_Keys" title="SSL_Gen_Keys" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you are running Windows, then you will not be able to use the shell script, however, you can follow the steps in either of my <a href="http://bryansaunders.net/blog/2012/07/03/generating-self-signed-certificates-for-mutual-authentication-in-java/" title="Generating Self-signed Certificates for Mutual Authentication in Java" target="_blank">previous</a> <a href="http://bryansaunders.net/blog/2012/07/03/generating-self-signed-certificates-for-use-in-java/" title="Generating Self-signed Certificates for use in Java" target="_blank">articles</a> to generate your keys.</p>
