This week I started taking the Camel Development with Red Hat JBoss Fuse ([JB421](http://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/jb421-camel-development-red-hat-jboss-fuse)) training course from Red Hat. I am taking the course online using the Red Hat Online Learning Environment, or ROLE. Even though I have been using Camel for the last few years on my projects, I want to start studying for the Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Camel Development ([EX421](http://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcoe-camel-development)). I figured what better place to start to brush up on the exam objectives than the recommended training course? And since its free for me being a Red Hat employee, why not.

As I am working through the course material, I plan on building a Study Guide with relevant resources and additional reading for each section of the training, as well as relating it all back to the specific exam objectives. I have searched high and low and have not been able to find anything like this for the exam, so I figured I might as well put something together.

Stay Tuned.
