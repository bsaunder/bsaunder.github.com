<p>I have recently migrated all of my source code repositories from Subversion to Git and have been using it extensively at work. Coming from Subversion to Git is a pretty major shift in how things work, but thankfully I found a great resource for learning the Ins and Outs of Git.</p>
<p><a href="http://gitimmersion.com/" target="_blank">Git Immersion</a> is an excellent resource for anyone who is interested in learning Git. It walks you through all of the major functions of Git as a series of small and precise labs. </p>
<p>If you need further assistance, you can also find a complete online copy of the book Pro Git available <a href="http://git-scm.com/book" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
