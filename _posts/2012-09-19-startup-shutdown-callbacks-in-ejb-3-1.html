<p>Every now and then you need to know when your application starts/stops so that you can perform some action. For years now this has been supported in Java by the Servlet Specification and its <em>ServletContextListener</em> class. Unfortunately this functionality was never offered by the EJB specification. With the release of EJB 3.1 and the @Singleton annotation, this functionality is now possible, and the code is much cleaner and simpler. Here is an example:</p>

{% highlight java %}
import javax.ejb.Singleton;
import javax.ejb.Startup;

@Startup
@Singleton
public class FooBean {
@PostConstruct
   void onStartup() {
      // Startup Stuff..
   }
   @PreDestroy
   void onShutdown() {
      // Shutdown Stuff..
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As you can see, the code is very simple and straight forward. There is no configuration needed. Just annotate your class/methods and the container will do the rest.</p>
<p>The @Startup annotation will cause the Singleton to initialize eagerly during the application startup sequence. Once all the injection has taken place, the container will call the bean's @PostConstruct method. Since the bean is container managed, you have access to all other EJB components, JPA EntityManagers, the TimerService, etc. And unlike other EJB component types, any container-managed transaction behavior for the bean applies to the @PostConstruct method as well.</p>
<p>By defining a @PreDestroy method the bean instance can request a shutdown notification. Since the Singleton bean instance life cycle is tied to the container's life cycle, this method will be called when the application is shutting down.</p>
