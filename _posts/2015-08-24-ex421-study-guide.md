# Audience &amp; Prerequisites

The following audiences may be interested in earning the Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Camel Development:
- Enterprise Java developers who are familiar with service-oriented architecture (SOA) principles and are responsible for integrating enterprise applications.
- Enterprise SOA architects with some Java development experience and knowledge of enterprise integration.

Exam candidates should:
- Have taken the Camel Development with Red Hat JBoss Fuse (RH421) course or have extensive work experience in enterprise integration using Apache Camel
- Have familiarity working in a Red Hat Enterprise LinuxÂ® environment
- Review the Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Camel Development exam (EX421) objectives


# Exam format

This exam is a performance-based evaluation of the candidate's Camel development skills and knowledge. Candidates perform tasks associated with the development and maintenance of enterprise integration patterns using Red Hat JBoss Fuse. Performance-based testing means that candidates must perform tasks similar to what they perform on the job.

This is a closed exam where candidates do not have access to the internet and candidates are not permitted to bring any papers, books or electronic aids to the exam. Candidates are, however, provided with a local copy of the official [JBoss Fuse documentation](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/JBoss_Fuse/). Candidates should familiarize themselves with this documentation when preparing for the exam.

This exam consists of 1 section lasting 4 hours.


# Scores and reporting

Official scores for exams come exclusively from Red Hat Certification Central. Red Hat does not authorize examiners or training partners to report results to candidates directly. Scores on the exam are usually reported within 3 U.S. business days.


# Recommended training

Camel Development with Red Hat JBoss Fuse ([JB421](http://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/jb421-camel-development-red-hat-jboss-fuse)) is the recommended training course for preparing for this exam.


# Exam Objectives & Resources

- **Gotchas**
  - When using the Java DSL there are limitations on how "deep" you can go into a route. If your code does not compile when using a CBR try using .endChoice() to return control back to the CBR. You can find more detailed information [here](http://camel.apache.org/why-can-i-not-use-when-or-otherwise-in-a-java-camel-route.html) Note that this is not an issue with XML Routes.
