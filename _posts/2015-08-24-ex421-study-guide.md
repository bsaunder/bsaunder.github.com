# Audience &amp; Prerequisites
The following audiences may be interested in earning the Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Camel Development:
- Enterprise Java developers who are familiar with service-oriented architecture (SOA) principles and are responsible for integrating enterprise applications.
- Enterprise SOA architects with some Java development experience and knowledge of enterprise integration.

Exam candidates should:
- Have taken the Camel Development with Red Hat JBoss Fuse (JB421) course or have extensive work experience in enterprise integration using Apache Camel
- Have familiarity working in a Red Hat Enterprise LinuxÂ® environment
- Review the Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Camel Development exam (EX421) objectives


# Exam format
This exam is a performance-based evaluation of the candidate's Camel development skills and knowledge. Candidates perform tasks associated with the development and maintenance of enterprise integration patterns using Red Hat JBoss Fuse. Performance-based testing means that candidates must perform tasks similar to what they perform on the job.

This is a closed exam where candidates do not have access to the internet and candidates are not permitted to bring any papers, books or electronic aids to the exam. Candidates are, however, provided with a local copy of the official [JBoss Fuse documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Fuse/6.0/). Candidates should familiarize themselves with this documentation when preparing for the exam.

This exam consists of 1 section lasting 4 hours.


# Scores and reporting
Official scores for exams come exclusively from Red Hat Certification Central. Red Hat does not authorize examiners or training partners to report results to candidates directly. Scores on the exam are usually reported within 3 U.S. business days.

# Recommended training
Camel Development with Red Hat JBoss Fuse ([JB421](http://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/jb421-camel-development-red-hat-jboss-fuse)) is the recommended training course for preparing for this exam.

# Additional Information
If you would like additional information about the exam and its format, you can check out the [Red Hat FAQ](http://www.innovativeexams.com/exam-faqs/red-hat-faq/) hosted by the exam company.

# Exam Objectives & Resources
This section will break down the exam by objectives and relate each objective back to the appropriate section in the JB421 training course and official documentation. Additional resources may also be referenced for some objectives when there is a need to provide more detail.

## Create & Maintain Camel Routes
Camel routes are the core construct within Camel and are used for routing messages. They are composed of Components and Endpoints and are created using one of many DSL's or XML based languages. The most common methods for creating a route are using the Java DSL or Spring XML.

### Use the Java language DSL
The Java based DSL uses a fluent builder style. The Java DSL is available by extending the RouteBuilder class and implementing the configure method.

### Use the CamelContext XML
The CamelContext XML is used with the Spring XML to create and define Camel routes. You can configure a CamelContext inside any spring.xml using the CamelContextFactoryBean. This will automatically start the CamelContext along with any referenced Routes along any referenced Component and Endpoint instances.

## Understand Exchange messages
An exchange stores messages received and transmitted using Camel routes. It stores routing information, the properties of the route/exchange itself, and the headers and properties of messages. The exchange is composed of an ID, Exchange Pattern (MEP), Properties, and two messages (In & Out).

### Work with Content-based router EIP
The Content Based Router EIP pattern allows you to route messages to the correct destination based on the contents of a message exchange. Expressions are utilized to evaluate the content of the exchange and determine where to route the message.docs.redhat.

- **Gotchas**
  - When using the Java DSL there are limitations on how "deep" you can go into a route. If your code does not compile when using a CBR try using .endChoice() to return control back to the CBR. You can find more detailed information [here](http://camel.apache.org/why-can-i-not-use-when-or-otherwise-in-a-java-camel-route.html) Note that this is not an issue with XML Routes.

### Work with Wire Tap EIP
The wire tap pattern enables you to route a copy of the message to a separate tap location, while the original message is forwarded to the ultimate destination.

## Exception Handling
Apache Camel provides several different mechanisms, which let you handle exceptions at different levels of granularity: you can handle exceptions within a route using doTry, doCatch, and doFinally; or you can specify what action to take for each exception type and apply this rule to all routes in a RouteBuilder using onException; or you can specify what action to take for all exception types and apply this rule to all routes in a RouteBuilder using errorHandler.
