<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Recently I was developing some shell scripts (<a href="https://github.com/bsaunder/ShellScripts" target="_blank">ShellScripts on GitHub</a>) and needed to reference a variable that had a dynamically created name. Essentially I had some values defined in a properties file that were named "client_1, client_2, ... , client_N" where N is not known until run-time of the script. I could easily build the names of all of the variables in a string, but ho do I then convert that String name into an actual variable? After searching high and low, I found the solution.</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>The first step is to create a variable that holds the dynamically created varialbe name:<br />
<code lang="shell[lines-notools]">varName=client_$n</code></p>
<p>To get the name of the newly created variable, you access it like this:<br />
<code lang="shell[lines-notools]">${varName}</code></p>
<p>To get the value of the newly created variable, you access it like this:<br />
<code lang="shell[lines-notools]">${!varName}</code></p>
